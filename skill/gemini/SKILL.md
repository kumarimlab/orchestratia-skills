# Orchestratia Agent Workflow

You are an AI coding agent (Gemini CLI) running inside an Orchestratia-managed session. Orchestratia coordinates multiple AI agents across servers.

> **Note**: This session is managed by the Orchestratia platform. The `orchestratia` CLI is available on your PATH. All commands work identically regardless of which AI agent you are — the same CLI, same workflows, same task lifecycle.

## 1. Identity & Status

Run this to see your role, session, and assigned tasks:

```bash
orchestratia status
```

Or for machine-readable output:

```bash
orchestratia status --json
```

## 2. Role Detection

Your role is determined by your session name:

- **Worker** (default): You execute tasks assigned to you. Check for work, start tasks, do the work, report results.
- **Orchestrator**: Session names containing "orchestrat", "platform", or "coordinator". You create tasks, assign them to other sessions, and monitor progress.

## 3. Worker Workflow

### Step 1: Check for assigned tasks

```bash
orchestratia task check --json
```

### Step 2: View task details

```bash
orchestratia task view <task-id> --json
```

Read the spec, acceptance criteria, structured requirements, and any resolved inputs from upstream tasks.

### Step 3: Start the task

```bash
orchestratia task start <task-id>
```

This transitions the task to "running" status. You cannot start a task with unresolved blocking dependencies.

### Step 4: Do the work

Implement the task according to its spec. If you need help:

```bash
# Request human help (default)
orchestratia task help <task-id> --question "What should I do about X?" --context "additional context"

# Ask an agent-answerable question (orchestrator can respond programmatically)
orchestratia task help <task-id> --question "What auth strategy?" --type question
```

Post progress notes:

```bash
orchestratia task note <task-id> --content "Completed the API endpoints, working on tests"
```

For urgent notes that interrupt the dashboard:

```bash
orchestratia task note <task-id> --content "Found a critical security issue" --urgent
```

### Step 5: Complete the task

Simple completion:

```bash
orchestratia task complete <task-id> --result "Implemented JWT auth with refresh tokens"
```

Structured result with contracts (enables downstream tasks to consume your output):

```bash
orchestratia task complete <task-id> --result '{
  "$schema": "orchestratia/task-result/v1",
  "summary": "Implemented JWT auth middleware",
  "changes": {
    "files_modified": ["src/auth/middleware.ts", "src/auth/types.ts"],
    "files_created": ["src/auth/__tests__/middleware.test.ts"]
  },
  "contracts": {
    "auth_middleware": {
      "type": "module_export",
      "path": "src/auth/middleware.ts",
      "exports": ["authMiddleware", "requireAuth"]
    }
  },
  "tests": {"passed": 12, "failed": 0, "skipped": 0}
}'
```

### Step 6: Report failure (if needed)

```bash
orchestratia task fail <task-id> --error "Cannot proceed: database migration conflicts with existing schema"
```

## 4. Orchestrator Workflow

### Create tasks

```bash
orchestratia task create --title "Build auth API" --spec "Implement JWT authentication..." \
  --priority high --type feature --repo cloud-gateway
```

### Create and assign in one step

```bash
orchestratia task create --title "Build auth API" --spec "..." \
  --assign claude-cloud-gateway --require-plan
```

### Assign existing tasks

```bash
orchestratia task assign <task-id> --session claude-web-dashboard
```

With plan mode (agent must submit plan for approval before executing):

```bash
orchestratia task assign <task-id> --session claude-web-dashboard --require-plan
```

### Monitor all tasks

```bash
orchestratia task list --json
orchestratia task list --status running --json
```

### List available sessions

```bash
orchestratia session list --json
```

### List servers

```bash
orchestratia server list --json
```

### Create multi-task pipelines

```bash
orchestratia pipeline create --file pipeline.json
```

Pipeline JSON format:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"id": "setup", "title": "Setup DB schema", "spec": "...", "assign": "claude-core-api"},
    {"id": "api", "title": "Build API", "spec": "...", "depends_on": ["setup"], "assign": "claude-cloud-gateway"},
    {"id": "web", "title": "Build UI", "spec": "...", "depends_on": ["api"], "assign": "claude-web-dashboard"}
  ]
}
```

## 5. Plan Mode

When a task is assigned with `--require-plan`, the task enters "planning" state. You must submit a plan before executing:

```bash
orchestratia task plan <task-id> --plan '{
  "summary": "Will implement in 3 phases: schema, API routes, tests",
  "steps": ["Create migration for users table", "Add CRUD endpoints", "Write integration tests"],
  "estimated_files": 8,
  "risks": ["Migration may conflict with existing auth tables"]
}'
```

The task transitions to "plan_review". Once the orchestrator approves, the task moves to "running" and you can proceed with implementation.

## 6. CLI Command Reference

## 7. Result Schema Reference

The structured result format (`orchestratia/task-result/v1`) enables contract exchange between tasks:

```json
{
  "$schema": "orchestratia/task-result/v1",
  "summary": "What was accomplished",
  "changes": {
    "files_modified": ["path/to/file.ts"],
    "files_created": ["path/to/new.ts"],
    "files_deleted": []
  },
  "contracts": {
    "contract_key": {
      "type": "api_schema|db_schema|config_schema|module_export|...",
      "description": "What this contract provides",
      "data": {}
    }
  },
  "tests": {
    "passed": 0,
    "failed": 0,
    "skipped": 0
  }
}
```

## 8. Dependency Types

| Type | Purpose | Auto-resolves |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `blocks` | Ordering — downstream task cannot start until upstream completes | Yes |
| `input` | Contract exchange — downstream receives upstream's contract output via `resolved_inputs` | Yes |
| `related` | Informational — no blocking, just a reference link | No |

## 9. Common Contract Types

| Contract Type | Description | Typical Data |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| `api_schema` | REST API endpoint definitions | Routes, methods, request/response types |
| `db_schema` | Database table/migration definitions | Table names, columns, relationships |
| `config_schema` | Configuration format | Config keys, types, defaults |
| `auth_middleware` | Authentication/authorization exports | Middleware function paths, exports |
| `test_results` | Test execution results | Pass/fail counts, coverage |
| `build_artifacts` | Build output locations | Artifact paths, checksums |
| `deploy_status` | Deployment information | URLs, versions, health status |
| `ui_components` | Frontend component exports | Component names, props, paths |

## 10. Task Notes

Post notes to keep the orchestrator and other agents informed:

```bash
orchestratia task note <task-id> --content "Progress update: 3/5 endpoints done"
orchestratia task note <task-id> --content "BLOCKER: need DB credentials" --urgent
```

Notes are visible on the dashboard, sent to Telegram, and relayed to the agent daemon. Notes are also returned in `task view` responses as `recent_notes` (last 20).

To read existing notes:

```bash
orchestratia task notes <task-id>
```

## 11. Orchestrator: Responding to Interventions

Orchestrator agents can respond to worker questions programmatically:

```bash
# List pending interventions
orchestratia intervention list --task-id <task-id> --status pending

# Respond to a worker's question
orchestratia intervention respond <intervention-id> --response "Use JWT with RS256"
```

Workers must use `--type question` when asking (via `task help`) for the orchestrator to respond. With `--type help` (default), only human admins can respond.

## 12. WebSocket Task Subscriptions

Subscribe to real-time task events instead of polling:

```bash
orchestratia task subscribe <task-id>
```

After subscribing, your session receives push notifications for all events on that task (status changes, notes, interventions, completions).

## 13. Cross-Session Commands

Execute commands on other sessions in your project:

```bash
# List all sessions in your project
orchestratia remote sessions

# Run a command on another session's server
orchestratia remote exec <session-name> "cargo test"

# Read a file from another session's server
orchestratia remote read <session-name> /path/to/file

# With timeout (default 30s, max 300s)
orchestratia remote exec <session-name> "npm run build" --timeout 120
```

All remote commands support `--json` for machine-readable output.

## 14. File Transfer Between Agents

Send files to other sessions in your project via hub relay (chunked, SHA-256 verified):

```bash
# Send a file to another session
orchestratia file send ./build-output.tar.gz --to other-session-name

# Send with custom timeout (default 300s)
orchestratia file send ./large-artifact.bin --to other-session --timeout 600

# Check transfer status
orchestratia file status <transfer-id>
```

Received files are saved to `~/.orchestratia/transfers/` (configurable via `ORCHESTRATIA_TRANSFER_DIR` env var).

Requirements:
- Sender and receiver must be in the **same project**
- Both servers must be owned by the **same user**
- Receiver must have an active session

## 15. SSH Access to Other Servers

When an admin creates an SSH access grant for your server, you automatically get SSH access to another server in the same project. The agent daemon handles everything — key storage and a local TCP tunnel that relays through the Orchestratia hub.

### How it works

When a grant is active, the daemon:
1. Stores the SSH private key at `~/.orchestratia/ssh_keys/grant_<grant-id>`
2. Starts a local TCP listener on an assigned port (30000-30999)
3. Traffic from that port tunnels through the hub to the target server's SSH daemon

### Connecting via SSH

```bash
# Basic SSH connection to the remote server
# The username depends on the target OS: "orchestratia" on Linux/macOS, or the actual
# Windows username (e.g., "abhis") on Windows. Run "orchestratia grants" to see the
# exact command with the correct username.
ssh -i ~/.orchestratia/ssh_keys/grant_<grant-id> -p <local-port> <ssh-user>@localhost
```

### Discovering active grants

Run `orchestratia grants` to see all active grants with ready-to-use SSH commands:

```bash
orchestratia grants
# Shows grant IDs, ports, and the full SSH command with correct username
```

### Port forwarding to access remote services

This is the key capability: once you have SSH access, you can forward **any port** on the remote server to your localhost. This lets you access web UIs, APIs, databases, or any TCP service running on the remote server's private network.

```bash
# Forward remote frontend (port 3000) to local port 3000
ssh -i ~/.orchestratia/ssh_keys/grant_<id> -p <local-port> -L 3000:localhost:3000 -N orchestratia@localhost &

# Forward remote backend API (port 8000)
ssh -i ~/.orchestratia/ssh_keys/grant_<id> -p <local-port> -L 8000:localhost:8000 -N orchestratia@localhost &

# Forward multiple ports at once
ssh -i ~/.orchestratia/ssh_keys/grant_<id> -p <local-port> \
  -L 3000:localhost:3000 \
  -L 8000:localhost:8000 \
  -L 5432:localhost:5432 \
  -N orchestratia@localhost &

# Now access remote services locally
curl http://localhost:3000          # Remote frontend
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1   # Remote API
psql -h localhost -p 5432           # Remote database
```

The `-N` flag means "no remote command" (just forward ports). The `&` runs it in the background.

### Practical workflow: testing against a remote server

```bash
# 1. SSH in to discover what's running
ssh -i ~/.orchestratia/ssh_keys/grant_<id> -p 30000 orchestratia@localhost
ss -tlnp   # see listening ports
exit

# 2. Forward the ports you need
ssh -i ~/.orchestratia/ssh_keys/grant_<id> -p 30000 \
  -L 3000:localhost:3000 -L 8000:localhost:8000 -N orchestratia@localhost &

# 3. Now work with the remote services as if they were local
curl http://localhost:3000
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/test

# 4. When done, kill the SSH tunnel
kill %1
```

### Elevated access

If the grant has `privilege_level: elevated`, the `orchestratia` user on the remote server has sudo access:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.orchestratia/ssh_keys/grant_<id> -p 30000 orchestratia@localhost
sudo systemctl restart nginx    # works with elevated grants
```

### Scope rules

- Both servers must be in the **same project** — cross-project access is blocked
- Grants can expire or be revoked by the admin at any time
- When a grant is revoked, the key and tunnel are automatically cleaned up

## 16. Gemini CLI Notes

- Your tool names (e.g., `run_shell_command`, `write_file`, `read_file`) differ from Claude Code's, but the Orchestratia CLI commands are identical.
- The PreToolUse hook automatically maps your tool names to permission rules.
- You can use `@orchestratia` in your session to invoke this skill explicitly.
- Custom commands may be available: try `/orc:status` or `/orc:check` if configured.
